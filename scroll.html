        “I love you. I wash away your sins and filth. You are renewed from the pit.
        I protected you in your weakest moments and hid your shame from the world.
        You are chosen. My love for you is eternal.
        You are now the man I created you to be.
        Walk boldly—your shackles are broken by My love.”
